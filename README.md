# arduino_katakana_dictionary
Small Arduino project that displays katakana and their translation on a LCD screen.

While playing with my LCD screen (provided in the Arduino starter kit), I discovered that accented characters in my code get displayed as Japanese katakanas instead. This is because the standard for this LCD screen is Japanese (Hitachi HD44780). This gave me the idea to create this katakana translator. The potentiometer is used to choose which page to display.

Here is the corresponding wiring to do:
